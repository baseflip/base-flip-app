# BaseFlip

Welcome to BaseFlip, a simple dapp that lets you challenge others to a game of coinflip. Here, you and another person bet an equal amount of ETH, and the winner takes it all

## A Word of Caution
This is an early version of BaseFlip, and while we've done our best to ensure everything runs smoothly, there might still be a few bugs lurking around. We recommend not using large amounts of ETH for this reason.

## Future Plans
We're constantly working to improve BaseFlip. In future versions, we plan to implement a more secure method for determining the winner as well as more features. Stay tuned for updates.

## How to use BaseFlip
1) First connect your wallet and make sure you're connected to Base mainnet

2) Enter how much ETH you want to bet and deposit the amount to the smart contract, once you deposit you will be given a link to share with the person you want to bet with

3) Click on copy to share the room link with someone, if the bet hasn't been accepted within 15 minutes it will expire and you will be able to withdraw your deposit

4) This is the page you see when you open the link as player 2, click on the accept button to deposit your ETH and start the game

5) As soon as player 2 accepts the bet the winner is determined onchain and a coinflip animation will play in the UI, the winning player can proceed to click on the withdraw button and collect their winnings. Good luck!
