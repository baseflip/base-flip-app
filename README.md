Welcome to BaseFlip, a simple dapp that lets you challenge your friends to a degen game of coinflip. Here, you and your friend bet an equal amount of ETH, and the winner takes it all

#A Word of Caution
This is an early version of BaseFlip, and while we've done our best to ensure everything runs smoothly, there might still be a few bugs lurking around. We recommend not using large amounts of ETH for this reason.

#Fair Play
Currently, we're using a pseudo-random method to determine the winner. While it's not easy to exploit, it's theoretically possible for someone with malicious intent to do so. So, we advise you to stick to playing with friends and avoid accepting large bets from strangers.

#Future Plans
We're constantly working to improve BaseFlip. In future versions, we plan to implement a more secure method for determining the winner as well as more features. Stay tuned for updates.
