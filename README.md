# Base Flip

This is a simple dapp on which you can challenge your friends to a 'game' of coinflip where both of you bet the same amount of ETH and the winner takes it all. Please don't use big amounts because this is a very early version of the dapp and there could be bugs. The dapp is also using a pseudo-random way to determine the winner at this point (will be changed in future versions) which shouldn't be an issue if you're playing with friends since it's not that easy to exploit but in theory it could be done by malicious actors so don't accept big bets from random people.
